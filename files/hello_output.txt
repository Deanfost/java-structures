I think an adept programmer should have at least undergraduate level knowledge in Computer Science. Sure, you can be effective at many jobs with only a small subset of Computer Science because of the rock solid community CS sits upon, and the narrowed focus of most professional positions. Also, many people will further specialize after undergraduate study. However, I do not think either are an excuse to not be privy of foundational CS knowledge.
